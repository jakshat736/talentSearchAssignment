# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm).

## Install Dependencies

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

This command installs all the dependencies required by the project. Make sure to run this command before using any of the scripts below.

## Available Scripts

After installing the dependencies, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\

.

if getting this error that means there is CORS error you have  to use the cors extension which will make it working

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
